         * @brief The Renderer function is responsible for managing the rendering loop.
         * It waits for a condition to resume rendering, processes rendering tasks, and
         * then pauses itself until the condition is met again.
         * 
         * The function performs the following steps:
         * 1. Waits for the render thread to be resumed.
         * 2. Saves the current time.
         * 3. Checks if the rendering scheduler needs to be terminated.
         * 4. Processes carry flags and updates the maximum width and height if needed.
         * 5. Renders the main frame buffer.
         * 6. Encodes the buffer for optimization.
         * 7. Converts the abstract frame buffer to a string and renders the frame.
         * 8. Calculates the render delay.
         * 9. Pauses the render thread and notifies all waiting threads.

         * @brief Event_Thread is a function that runs an infinite loop to handle various events and tasks.
         * 
         * This function performs the following tasks in each iteration of the loop:
         * - Resets the thread load counter and updates the previous time.
         * - Calls functions to recall memories, go through file streams, and refresh the multi-frame canvas.
         * - Checks for termination signals and breaks out of the loop if the terminate flag is set.
         * - Updates the current time and calculates the delta time.
         * - Adjusts the current update speed based on the event thread load.
         * - Sleeps for a calculated duration to control the update speed.
         * 
         * The function is designed to be used in a multi-threaded environment where it can be paused and resumed as needed.
         * 
         * @note If uncapped FPS is desired, the sleep code can be disabled.

         * This function runs an infinite loop where it performs the following steps:
         * 1. Waits for user input by calling INTERNAL::Query_Inputs().
         * 2. Pauses the GGUI system and performs the following actions:
         *    - Records the current time as INTERNAL::Previous_Time.
         *    - Translates the queried inputs using INTERNAL::Translate_Inputs().
         *    - Processes scroll and mouse inputs using SCROLL_API() and MOUSE_API().
         *    - Calls the event handlers to react to the parsed input using Event_Handler().
         *    - Records the current time as INTERNAL::Current_Time.
         *    - Calculates the delta time (input delay) and stores it in INTERNAL::Input_Delay.
