# Export helpers

This folder contains the tools to build/export amalgamated headers and prebuilt libraries.

On windows simply run:
```bash
./bin/export.bat
```

On linux simply run:
```bash
./bin/export.sh
```

Old and manual way of doing this:
```bash
g++ buildGGUILib.cpp && ./a.exe
```
