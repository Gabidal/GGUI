# Code of Conduct 🫘+🧊=❤️

We follow the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/3/0/code_of_conduct/).

### Short Version
Be respectful, constructive, and inclusive. Harassment or discrimination is not tolerated.  

### Competitive Spirit
This project encourages **strong technical debate and competitiveness**.  
- Pointing out flaws or suggesting a better approach is welcome (even if blunt).  
- Criticism must be directed at the code or idea, **not the person**.  
- Passion is fine, but personal attacks, humiliation, or hostility are not.  

In short: *“Your code can suck, you don’t.”*

### Enforcement
Report issues privately to the maintainer (@Gabidal).  
Actions may include warnings, PR lock, or ban for repeated violations.
